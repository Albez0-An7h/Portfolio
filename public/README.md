# Image Assets

Place your image files in this directory structure:

- `/public/images/projects/devos.png` - DevOS project thumbnail
- `/public/images/sign.jpg` - Your logo/signature for the navbar
- `/public/images/profile-pic.jpeg` - Your profile picture
- `/public/Incognito-Icons.png` - The favicon for your site

If you don't have these exact files, replace them with your own images and update the paths in the corresponding code files.
